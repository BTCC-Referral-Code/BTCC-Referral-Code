<h2>What Is the BTCC Referral Program?</h2>
<p>
BTCC’s referral program is designed to reward both new and existing users. By sharing your unique <strong>BTCC promo code</strong> or invite link, you can invite friends to sign up and trade on BTCC’s platform. When your referees use your code during their <strong>BTCC signup</strong>, they qualify for a <strong>BTCCBONUS</strong>—which can include up to <strong>11,000 USDT</strong> in rewards and a <strong>50% discount on trading fees</strong>.
</p>
<p>
This program benefits both parties: new users enjoy trading bonuses and discounts, while referrers earn commissions and ongoing trading rewards from their invitees’ activities.
